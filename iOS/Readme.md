# Building a simple lane detection iOS app using OpenCV

## Getting started
In this section we will cover the steps to build an iOS app that contains a view controller which will display the back camera feed of the iOS device and overlay any road lane on top of the camera feed on the screen.

### To achieve that we will:
- Create SimpleLaneDetection app project
- Process frames from the back camera
- Import OpenCV
- Insert lane detector algorithm into the project
- Consume lane detector algorithm from Swift
- Display lane detection results
